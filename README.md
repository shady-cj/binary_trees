# binary_trees

Learning about binary trees... This is a team project and the main goal by the end of this team project is to fully understand:

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree


## TASKS


### 0. New node

Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
* And value is the value to put in the new node
* When created, a node does not have any child
* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure


**Files** - 0-binary_tree_node.c


```
alex@/tmp/binary_trees$ cat 0-main.c 
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "binary_trees.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void)
{
    binary_tree_t *root;

    root = binary_tree_node(NULL, 98);

    root->left = binary_tree_node(root, 12);
    root->left->left = binary_tree_node(root->left, 6);
    root->left->right = binary_tree_node(root->left, 16);

    root->right = binary_tree_node(root, 402);
    root->right->left = binary_tree_node(root->right, 256);
    root->right->right = binary_tree_node(root->right, 512);

    binary_tree_print(root);
    return (0);

### 1. Insert left

Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
* And value is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
* If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

### 2. Insert right

Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

* Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
* Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
* And value is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
* If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.
